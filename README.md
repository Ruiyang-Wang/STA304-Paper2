# 2024 US Election Prediction
# For Peer reviewers:
# The paper2.pdf include my paper overall frame and graphs, ALL words in this paper draft is now randomly generated with no relate to my predictions and words, I will change them after the initial submission. Please tell me about what else should I need in my graphs and analysis, and what more points should be added to my paper's overall frame. Thank you!


## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation for their own projects associated with *Telling Stories with Data*. You do not need every aspect for every paper and you should delete aspects that you do not need.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

In this project, I utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks related to data cleaning and visualization, such as aiding in the generation of R code for graphing and data manipulation. Additionally, LLMs were consulted to provide guidance on citation formatting in R, specifically for creating .bib entries.

Importantly, LLMs were not used to generate any word-paragraphs, substantive text, or perform analysis in the final version of my paper. However, some randomly generated phrases or content might appear in early drafts of the paper to illustrate the general framework and provide better context for peer reviewers during the drafting process. These placeholders will be replaced with my own work in the final submission.



## Some checks
